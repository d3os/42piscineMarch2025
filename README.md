There is my work during march 2025 piscine in 42 Paris, it is my way, not THE solution, build your own.
All the C modules I did are completed 100% even the time it took me (but not the shell modules).
All the files are 100% moulinette certified.

I have not been admitted, probably due to a lack of investment. My tips to not be like me :

TECHNIC / SKILLS / KNOWLEDGE
- If you good at C and programming : Create a group around you, share your knowledge, encourages mutual aid in your group.
- If you suck at C and programming -> be part of one of the group formed around 1 or some motor elements
  => don't forget to vote at Voxotron to demonstrate this
- In both case do reviews again and again, it is THE WAY 42 consider you learn from, and to, others.
  Do it regullary even if you don't need points to get reviewed, give your extra to the pool.
- Do not try BSQ  if you have'nt done C 9 module, it's a waste of time

LIFE / WORKING / MANAGEMENT OF TIME
- Try to come everyday, at least be regular -> same hours of presence each day
- Do not do less or too many hours in a day, (6h/day is not very impressive, 8 is ok, 9 or 10 can be impressive if you are able to maintain it all the four weeks)
- Don't bite off more than you can chew, regularity and sustainability, If you give all at the start and can't sustain you are fucked
- Try rushes at least 1 and 2, the first is very easy, 2 3 4 are each harder than the previous one.

SOCIAL / RELATIONS / BEING
- Don't be punished, or the less at possible (bottle on table, shoes off, etc etc ...)
- Be polite and friendly even of people who seem strange to you (you will meet some for sure)
- DO NOT TALK / INTRODUCE / SHARE about your politics opinions, a weird guy get banned of my session for sharing his patreon with a potitized article on it
- DO EVENTS, some events bring more points in one action than a entire day of reviewing (+ the head coalition give +4,2% xp to its members)
